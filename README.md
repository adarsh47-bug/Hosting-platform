# 🌐 Static Site Hosting Platform – Mini Project (MERN Stack)

A simple and user-friendly platform to host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS) under custom, user-specific URLs.  
Built using the **MERN stack** with a focus on beginner-friendly deployment and scalability.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ✅ Minimalist 1–2 step workflow for deployment
- ✅ User-specific custom URLs
- ✅ Clean React-based frontend UI
- ✅ MongoDB for managing user/project metadata
- ✅ Scalable and beginner-friendly design

## 🎯 Project Objective

This platform was developed as a college **mini project** to:

- Simplify static website deployment for students and beginners
- Provide a real-world MERN stack development experience
- Emphasize scalability and usability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Storage Structure:** Organized under user/project folders

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **User uploads** a static site (e.g., a zipped folder with `index.html`, CSS, JS).
2. The backend **extracts and stores** the files under a unique path.
3. The platform **generates a custom URL**, e.g., `yoursite.com/username/projectname/`.
4. The static site is **immediately live** at that URL.
